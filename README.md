# Mojira Bugs Viewer
A site to view Minecraft bugs, because the official one(s) are bad, showing incomplete information and requiring log-in to view attachments.

Currently mostly functional, but still under construction and requiring a great deal of polish.

Check it out at [mojira.tornato.dev](https://mojira.tornato.dev).
